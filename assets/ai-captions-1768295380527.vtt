00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.560
You know,

1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.279
in the construction and design world,

2
00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:05.469
there's a three letter acronym that gets thrown around all the time,

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.170
BIM,

4
00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:07.119
but what is it?

5
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:07.829
Really?

6
00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.569
Today we're gonna cut through the noise and get to what BIM actually is

7
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.229
and why getting it right is so

8
00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:15.630
critical for everyone in Singapore's built environment.

9
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:16.610
So,

10
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.569
let me just ask you,

11
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.520
when you hear the word BIM,

12
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.409
what's the first thing that comes to mind?

13
00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:22.819
Is it a piece of software,

14
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.329
you know,

15
00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.899
a powerful tool for creating those really slick,

16
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.899
complex 3D models of buildings?

17
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.809
If that's you,

18
00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:29.459
hey,

19
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.959
you are definitely not alone.

20
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.930
Because that right there is the number one misconception,

21
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.169
that BIIM is just a 3D model,

22
00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:37.520
that it's the final product,

23
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380
the pretty picture you show to a client.

24
00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:40.810
But here's the thing,

25
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.259
that's like looking at the tip of an iceberg.

26
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.479
The real value,

27
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.029
the real power of BIM

28
00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:49.110
is everything that's happening just below the surface.

29
00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.889
OK,

30
00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.250
so this is the big mental shift we need to make.

31
00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.069
BIIM is not a thing.

32
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.250
It's not a piece of software you buy off a shelf,

33
00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.049
it's a process you adopt.

34
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.500
And honestly,

35
00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.099
the clue is right there in the name,

36
00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:02.000
building

37
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.400
information management.

38
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.410
The keywords aren't really building,

39
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.279
they're information and management.

40
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.839
It's all about having a structured way to create and handle all the project data,

41
00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.959
from the very first sketch all the way to demolition.

42
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.440
And this table really nails the difference.

43
00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.980
See,

44
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.440
traditional 3D modeling,

45
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.000
that's all about geometry,

46
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.639
what the building looks like.

47
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.559
But BIIM,

48
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.970
BIM's focus is on the information,

49
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.839
the data behind the geometry.

50
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.410
It's not just a picture,

51
00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:30.290
it's a living,

52
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.529
breathing database for the entire project.

53
00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.300
So what does that look like in practice?

54
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.790
Well,

55
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.440
instead of everyone working in their own little silo,

56
00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:39.800
all the key players,

57
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.870
the architects,

58
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.790
the engineers,

59
00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:42.910
the contractors,

60
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.900
they're all plugged into one central shared model.

61
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.260
Think of it like a master Google Doc for the building.

62
00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:49.199
Everybody contributes.

63
00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:52.504
and everybody works from that same single source of truth.

64
00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:54.605
It's a real digital ecosystem.

65
00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:55.084
So,

66
00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:55.514
OK,

67
00:01:55.654 --> 00:01:56.334
it's a process,

68
00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:57.294
it's collaborative,

69
00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:58.894
it's all about information,

70
00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:00.084
but so what?

71
00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:02.574
Why does this actually matter to your projects,

72
00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:03.684
to your bottom line?

73
00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.434
What's the real value here?

74
00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:05.934
Well,

75
00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:06.644
to get it,

76
00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.774
just think back to the pain of the old 2D workflow.

77
00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:11.035
You know what I'm talking about.

78
00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:13.975
Every team in their own corner with their own drawings.

79
00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.695
The information is out of date the second it's printed.

80
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.110
And what does that lead to?

81
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.149
Clashes,

82
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.389
massive coordination headaches on site,

83
00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:22.220
and of course,

84
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.229
all that expensive rework and delays we all dread.

85
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.039
This brings us to a really smart concept called the McLeamy curve,

86
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.320
and it shows something we kind of know intuitively,

87
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.740
right?

88
00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.589
The earlier you make a decision,

89
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.279
the cheaper it is to change.

90
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.059
Fixing something in a drawing costs almost nothing.

91
00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.460
Fixing that same mistake with steel and concrete on site,

92
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.000
well,

93
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.339
that's a whole different story.

94
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.880
BIMM is all about shifting our effort to the left,

95
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.509
to the beginning of the project,

96
00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.479
where we can make the biggest impact for the lowest cost.

97
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.479
And Singapore's own Building and Construction Authority sums

98
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.220
this up perfectly with their build twice philosophy.

99
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.020
It's simple.

100
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.419
You build the entire project virtually in the model first,

101
00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.179
and only then do you go and build it for real on site.

102
00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.320
And the benefit of that approach is just clear as day.

103
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.889
When you build it digitally,

104
00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.210
you find all the problems,

105
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300
you resolve all the clashes before anyone even steps foot on site.

106
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.500
That directly cuts down on rework,

107
00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.649
which at the end of the day,

108
00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.000
saves a ton of time and a ton of money.

109
00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:20.580
Now,

110
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.860
listen,

111
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.059
this isn't just some nice idea or a best practice

112
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.460
for all of us here in Singapore,

113
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.039
this whole way of thinking

114
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.220
is quickly becoming the new reality,

115
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.639
mandated from the top.

116
00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.729
The Singapore government is really pushing this whole

117
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.360
transformation forward with its Cet X platform.

118
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.779
This whole initiative is designed to make the regulatory

119
00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.479
and approval process way more integrated and digital.

120
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.369
And let's be really clear about what that means.

121
00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.240
Coreet X is making digital submissions through BIM the new standard.

122
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.770
This is not just for the early adopters anymore.

123
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.600
It's becoming the basic requirement

124
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.059
to get major projects approved and off the ground.

125
00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.550
Which brings us right back to where we started.

126
00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.080
This whole push for digital submission isn't really

127
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.309
about forcing everyone to buy new software,

128
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.190
it's about pushing the industry to adopt a new way of working,

129
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.279
a more collaborative,

130
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.500
data-driven process,

131
00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.119
the very thing that defines what real BIM is.

132
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.520
So I'll leave you with this final question to think about.

133
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.608
Do you still see BIM as just another tool that you buy,

134
00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:19.500
or do you see it as a core strategy you need to adopt?

135
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.089
Because how you and your organization answer that question,

136
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.609
well,

137
00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.279
that's probably going to define your place

138
00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.339
in the future of Singapore's built environment.
